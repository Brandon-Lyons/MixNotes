  As a user
  I want to post a reply

  Scenario: User posts a reply to a comment
    Given I am signed in
    And I have the following mixes:
      | title           | artist   | admin          |
      | Blue and Yellow | The Used | me@example.com |
    And mix "Blue and Yellow" has the following comments:
      | time | content            |
      | 0    | Great drum groove! |
    When I view mix "Blue and Yellow"
    And I fill in "reply_content" with "Totally!"
    And I click element "#new_reply > input[type="submit"]"
    And I should see "Totally!"
    And I should see "me@example.com"
